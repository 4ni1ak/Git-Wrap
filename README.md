## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Python 3.11**: Core programming language.
- **Flask 3.0**: Lightweight WSGI web application framework.
- **Redis**: High-performance in-memory data store for caching analysis results.
- **GitHub GraphQL API**: For fetching precise contribution data (including private repos) efficiently.
- **GitHub REST API**: For fetching public repository metadata.
- **Gunicorn**: Production-grade WSGI HTTP server.

### Frontend
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Modern, responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Lightweight client-side logic for interactivity and API communication.
- **Canvas API**: For generating the shareable image directly in the browser.

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization for easy deployment (App + Redis).
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and building.

## ⚡ Performance & Optimization

We have engineered Git-Wrap to handle massive GitHub profiles (like Linus Torvalds) and high traffic efficiently:

*   **🚀 Smart Redis Caching:** Analysis results are cached for **3 days** (sliding window). If a user is queried again, the timer resets, keeping popular profiles instantly available.
*   **🧠 Intelligent Freshness Check:** The system automatically checks the user's latest activity event. If a new commit/event is detected since the last cache, the cache is invalidated and fresh data is fetched immediately.
*   **🛡️ Robust API Handling:** Built-in retry mechanisms and DNS failover (Google DNS) ensure stability even during temporary network glitches.
*   **📦 Full Scale Analysis:** Optimized to process **100% of repositories** without timeouts, regardless of the profile size.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/4ni1ak/Git-Wrap.git
    cd Git-Wrap    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file from the example:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    *Optional:* Add your `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `.env` to include private repository stats.

3.  **Run with Docker Compose:**
    This will start both the Flask application and the Redis service.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Access the App:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3020`.

### Manual Installation

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## 🔧 Configuration

### GitHub Token (Optional but Recommended)

To include private repository contributions and avoid API rate limits, you need a GitHub Personal Access Token.

1.  Go to [GitHub Settings > Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
2.  Generate a new token (classic).
3.  Select scopes: `repo` (for private repos) and `read:user`.
4.  Add it to your `.env` file: `GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...`
